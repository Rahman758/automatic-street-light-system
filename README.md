# automatic-street-light-system
An automatic/emergency street lighting system based on light intensity. Lights turn on progressively as surrounding light decreases, using a basic LDR-based control logic. Useful for street lighting, home automation, and industrial applications.

# 💡 Emergency/Automatic Street Light System (Using Light Intensity)

A simple and effective light automation system that responds to ambient light intensity using basic electronic components. This project automatically controls street or home lights based on real-time environmental lighting conditions.


## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project is to design a **basic automatic/emergency light system** that switches lights ON/OFF based on the **intensity of light** detected by an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor).

- If light intensity is **high** (greater than threshold), **no lights** are turned on.
- As light intensity **decreases**, **lights turn on progressively**.
- Useful for **street lights**, **emergency pathways**, **home automation**, and more.


## ⚙️ Working Principle

- An **LDR** is used to detect ambient light levels.
- Based on the voltage drop across a set resistance threshold (e.g., > 3kΩ), different lights are triggered.
- The system activates **more lights** as the environment gets **darker**.
- The circuit can be built using **transistors, resistors, relays, and power LEDs**.


## 🛠️ Components Used

- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- Resistors (variable and fixed)
- Transistors (e.g., BC547 or 2N2222)
- LEDs / Street light simulation
- Relay module (for AC lights, optional)
- Power supply (5V or 12V DC)


## ⚡ Applications

- Smart **Street Lighting**
- **Emergency Lighting** in low visibility conditions
- **Home Automation** for rooms, garages, balconies
- **Industrial Lighting Systems**
